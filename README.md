# Global Intelligence Trends Analysis
This analysis explores the global intelligence trends by examining various socio-economic indicators like IQ, Human Development Index (HDI), Gross National Income (GNI), literacy rates, and Nobel Prize achievements. By examining these variables, the goal is to identify patterns and correlations that could inform educational policy and economic development strategies. 

## Data Preparation & Cleanup
Data Cleaning: Missing values in columns such as HDI, GNI, Mean Years of Schooling, and Population were handled using imputation techniques to ensure consistency in the dataset. Additionally, the "Population - 2023" column was formatted to ensure it's numeric for the subsequent analysis.

### Data Formatting: Ensured that all columns were properly formatted and structured to fit the model inputs.

## Identifying Leading and Lagging Countries
Leading Countries: Countries such as the United States, Germany, and the UK show notable achievement, particularly in terms of Nobel laureates, which correlate with high IQs and socio-economic development.

Lagging Countries: Sub-Saharan African nations, on the other hand, exhibit lower IQ scores and HDI, reflecting the socio-economic challenges they face. These countries often have the lowest IQs and poorer development indicators.

## Correlation Analysis
Correlation Matrix: A correlation matrix was generated to identify relationships between socio-economic factors like literacy rates, GNI, HDI, and IQ. The analysis revealed strong positive correlations:
Literacy Rate & IQ: Higher literacy rates are generally associated with higher IQ scores at the national level.
GNI & IQ: Wealthier countries tend to have higher IQ scores, suggesting a link between economic prosperity and cognitive performance.
HDI & IQ: Countries with higher HDI scores also show higher IQs, reinforcing the idea that development drives cognitive capabilities.
Key Insight: The strongest correlations were observed between Mean Years of Schooling and IQ, emphasizing the role of education in cognitive development.

## Hypothesis Testing
Hypothesis 1: Higher literacy rates correlate with higher IQs – Supported by correlation findings.

Hypothesis 2: More years of schooling contribute to higher IQs – Supported by the strong relationship between mean years of schooling and IQ.

Hypothesis 3: Higher HDI is linked with more Nobel laureates – Supported by the observation that developed countries with high HDI (e.g., the US, Germany) have a higher number of Nobel Prize winners.

Hypothesis 4: Wealthier countries (higher GNI) are more likely to produce Nobel laureates – Supported by the data, with wealthier nations like the US showing higher academic and research achievements.

Hypothesis 5: Larger populations correlate with more Nobel laureates – Partially supported, as countries with larger populations tend to have larger talent pools, but it isn't the only contributing factor.

## Machine Learning Model
Linear Regression Model: A regression model was created to predict national IQ scores using predictors like literacy rate, mean years of schooling, and HDI.

### Model Performance:
R-squared Value: 0.62 – indicating that the model explains about 62% of the variance in national IQ scores.
MSE (Mean Squared Error): 47.52 – highlighting that while the model captures the general trend, there may still be deviations in individual predictions.

## Visualizations
Bar Charts: Used to show the top and bottom 10 countries in terms of IQ, HDI, and Nobel laureates.

Scatter Plots: Displayed the relationships between IQ, literacy rate, and mean years of schooling across different continents.

Heatmaps: Used to visualize the correlation between socio-economic factors like GNI, literacy rates, and IQ scores.

Choropleth Maps: Geographical maps were created to visualize the global distribution of IQ scores, where darker regions indicate higher IQ and socio-economic development.

## Geographical Trends
### Regional Analysis:
Developed countries in Europe, North America, and parts of Asia generally show higher IQ scores and higher development indicators.
Developing nations in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and parts of Latin America face socio-economic challenges, reflected in lower IQ scores and HDI.
### Potential Implications
Educational Policy: Countries with low IQ scores could benefit from targeted educational reforms, emphasizing increasing literacy rates and years of schooling.

Economic Development: Investment in education, healthcare, and infrastructure in developing countries could lead to improved HDI and, by extension, higher IQ scores and socio-economic development.

Innovation & Research: Countries with high IQs and socio-economic development (e.g., the US, Germany) demonstrate that fostering a research-driven culture and investing in academic institutions can drive innovation and high academic achievement, particularly through Nobel Prize-winning research.

## Further Exploration
Additional Models: While linear regression offers insights, exploring more complex models like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting might improve the predictive accuracy of IQ scores.

## Cultural Biases: The analysis assumes that IQ tests are culturally neutral, which might not be the case. Further research could explore how cultural, societal, and environmental factors influence test scores, particularly in non-Western countries.

## Conclusion
This comprehensive analysis highlights key trends in global intelligence by examining the relationship between IQ and various socio-economic factors. The findings suggest that education, economic prosperity, and social development are closely linked to cognitive performance on a national scale. The insights provided can help policymakers, educators, and researchers target areas for improvement in education and socio-economic development.
