# Global Intelligence Trends Analysis
This analysis explores the global intelligence trends by examining various socio-economic indicators like IQ, Human Development Index (HDI), Gross National Income (GNI), literacy rates, and Nobel Prize achievements. By examining these variables, the goal is to identify patterns and correlations that could inform educational policy and economic development strategies. The project also compares global intelligence indicators over 20 years and makes a forecast of what these indicators will be in two decades.

## Data Preparation & Cleanup
Data Cleaning: Missing values in columns such as HDI, GNI, Mean Years of Schooling, and Population were handled using imputation techniques to ensure consistency in the dataset. Additionally, the "Population - 2023" column was formatted to ensure it's numeric for the subsequent analysis. A feature engineering attribute was created â€“ HDI per capita.

## Identifying Leading and Lagging Countries
Leading Countries: Countries such as the United States, Germany, and the UK show notable achievement, particularly in terms of Nobel laureates, which correlate with high IQs and socio-economic development.

Lagging Countries: Sub-Saharan African nations, on the other hand, exhibit lower IQ scores and HDI, reflecting the socio-economic challenges they face. These countries often have the lowest IQs and poorer development indicators.

## Correlation Analysis
Correlation Matrix: A correlation matrix was generated to identify relationships between socio-economic factors like literacy rates, GNI, HDI, and IQ. The analysis revealed strong positive correlations:
Literacy Rate & IQ: Higher literacy rates are generally associated with higher IQ scores at the national level.
GNI & IQ: Wealthier countries tend to have higher IQ scores, suggesting a link between economic prosperity and cognitive performance.
HDI & IQ: Countries with higher HDI scores also show higher IQs, reinforcing the idea that development drives cognitive capabilities.
Key Insight: The strongest correlations were observed between Mean Years of Schooling and IQ, emphasizing the role of education in cognitive development.

## Hypothesis Testing
Several hypotheses were analyzed to explore the relationship between intelligence, education, and socio-economic factors. It was confirmed that higher literacy rates correlate with higher IQs and that more years of schooling contribute to increased intelligence. Additionally, the study found that countries with higher Human Development Index (HDI) values tend to produce more Nobel laureates, as seen in developed nations like the US and Germany. Wealthier countries, measured by Gross National Income (GNI), also show a higher likelihood of producing Nobel Prize winners, reinforcing the link between economic prosperity and intellectual achievements. Furthermore, while larger populations generally correlate with more Nobel laureates due to a larger talent pool, other factors also play a role. Lastly, the study tested the hypothesis that global IQ levels have increased over the past 20 years, assessing whether improvements in education, access to information, and living conditions have contributed to this trend.

## Machine Learning Model
Linear Regression Model: A regression model was created to predict national IQ scores using predictors like literacy rate, mean years of schooling, and HDI. Additionally, predictions were made to estimate global IQ levels in 2043, providing insights into future trends. The analysis also examined the required years of schooling and literacy levels needed to improve national IQ, helping to identify key educational and developmental factors that contribute to intelligence growth.

## Visualizations
Bar Charts: Used to show the top and bottom 10 countries in terms of IQ, HDI, and Nobel laureates.

Scatter Plots: Displayed the relationships between IQ, literacy rate, and mean years of schooling across different continents.

Heatmaps: Used to visualize the correlation between socio-economic factors like GNI, literacy rates, and IQ scores.

Choropleth Maps: Geographical maps were created to visualize the global distribution of IQ scores, where darker regions indicate higher IQ and socio-economic development.

Additionally, an interactive dashboard was built to present these visualizations, allowing for dynamic exploration of global intelligence trends and socio-economic factors.

## Geographical Trends
### Regional Analysis:
Developed countries in Europe, North America, and parts of Asia generally show higher IQ scores and higher development indicators.
Developing nations in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and parts of Latin America face socio-economic challenges, reflected in lower IQ scores and HDI.
### Potential Implications
Educational Policy: Countries with low IQ scores could benefit from targeted educational reforms, emphasizing increasing literacy rates and years of schooling.

Economic Development: Investment in education, healthcare, and infrastructure in developing countries could lead to improved HDI and, by extension, higher IQ scores and socio-economic development.

Innovation & Research: Countries with high IQs and socio-economic development (e.g., the US, Germany) demonstrate that fostering a research-driven culture and investing in academic institutions can drive innovation and high academic achievement, particularly through Nobel Prize-winning research.

## Further Exploration
Additional Models: While linear regression offers insights, exploring more complex models like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting might improve the predictive accuracy of IQ scores.

## Ethical Considerations
The study acknowledges potential privacy concerns related to data collection and processing. Publicly available datasets were used, and no personally identifiable information was included. Bias in data sources and models was considered, and efforts were made to ensure fair and representative analyses.

IQ tests are not an absolute measure of intelligence. They can be influenced by cultural and educational biases, as different tests are used across countries and populations. Additionally, there is no standardized global IQ measurement, so researchers must rely on sporadic studies conducted at different times with varying methodologies. This means the data may not always be fully representative of entire populations. 

## Cultural Biases
The analysis assumes that IQ tests are culturally neutral, which might not be the case. Further research could explore how cultural, societal, and environmental factors influence test scores, particularly in non-Western countries.

## Unresolved Issues
Some limitations persist due to constraints in the frameworks and technologies used. While significant efforts were made to refine data processing and model accuracy, certain challenges, such as incomplete datasets, inconsistencies across sources, and model biases-remain. 

Throughout the project, gaps in knowledge, particularly in advanced machine learning techniques and data visualization best practices, were identified.
